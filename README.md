# Elena Yatzeck

## Senior Business Intelligence Specialist
I'm a Business Intelligence Specialist with a knack for turning data into actionable insights. I excel at finding, extracting, analyzing, and visualizing complex datasets to drive model development and informed decision-making. 

By harnessing cutting-edge tools and techniques, I transform raw information into strategic business intelligence, enabling companies to optimize operations, identify growth opportunities, and stay ahead in today's competitive landscape. Let's empower your organization with data-driven success.

In terms of my background, I started coding in graduate school when I was working on my PhD in English Literature, which I got, but once the rubber hit the road, I didn't want to be an English professor, so I went into software engineering full time.  I gradually moved into management (line management, product management, project management, program management -- all the Ps), but I am taking advantage of some severance from my last job to invest time and energy into updating my software engineering skills, learn some more tools, and go back into the workforce with a lot more of a hands-on approach.

I'm excited to be working with SavvyCoders on this goal -- you guys are very enabling.

## Goals for data analytics course
* Learn to set up an IDE, and become comfortable with git and github (I came in with a coding background, so learning python is not a key goal for me, but I don't have up to date experience on the devops side)
* Do a capstone project, to:
  * Go through the end to end process of creating a data analysis visualization
  * Learn more python tools, in service of the capstone (eg [beautifulsoup](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/))
  * Go through the process of creating a capstone video
  * Have the capstone project as part of the portfolio I can present to potential employers.
* Incorporate hands-on data analysis in the next job I get
  * Understand what job title and elevator pitch appropriately capture what I want to do.
  * Update and improve my job hunting collateral
  * Receive knowledgeable guidance about what organizations and positions to target
  * Benefit as appropriate from SavvyCoders's extensive network of connections with employers in the Midwest

I love that this image summarizes the whole data science life cycle.  I am working to pick up some data science tools on my own, in addition to what we are learning for the class, so I like seeing the whole picture, not just the data analysis part.
