## **Speeches**

Everyday there are opportunities to market yourself and pitch your brand. You want to be ready to shine when those moments come!

The moment dictates what type of speech ew can deliver. Sometimes it's a quick Elevator pitch, an introductory speech, or a full presentation. By preparing in advance for every occasion, you'll always be ready to deliver!

### Elevator Pitch

- What is it?
- Who is the target audience?
- What is your "Unique Selling Proposition" or what makes you difference from the competition?
- Close with a strong "Call to Action"!

Hi, I'm Elena.  I’m a seasoned product visionary who puts teeth into optimizing performance of enterprise teams delivering strategic technical capabilities. I can bring data-driven decision making to stakeholders from C suite to quirky brilliant individual contributors, and I can move from broad strategic vision to highly tactical execution at a moment's notice.  I’m looking for an organization which values honest, prompt, pragmatic, data-driven decision making.  I'm interested that your organization is "doing something--fill in as appropriate", and I would love to be part of that because xyz."  Can you tell me how this role fits into that mission?

Your elevator pitch for mock interviews should be (approximately):

Hi, I'm Elena, I'm a seasoned product visionary, with deep experience in sql and Tableau.
I am currently enrolled with Savvy to enhance my skills around python, the git/github ecosystem, 
and the end to end data analysis/data science pipeline.
I chose a capstone about AirBnb rental volumes and rates in Chicago because I've used AirBnb, and NYC's changes in policy are in the news, and I was curious what the investment climate for AirBNB has been in Chicago, and what the impact has been on the Chicago long term rental market.

### Introductory Speech

The introduction speech is meant for Demo Day. It builds on the Elevator Pitch. The individuals that come to Demo Day want to hear a bit of a “story” about you, how you got to Demo Day, and about your capstone project!
