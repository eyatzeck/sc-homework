## **Speeches**

Everyday there are opportunities to market yourself and pitch your brand. You want to be ready to shine when those moments come!

The moment dictates what type of speech ew can deliver. Sometimes it's a quick Elevator pitch, an introductory speech, or a full presentation. By preparing in advance for every occasion, you'll always be ready to deliver!

### Elevator Pitch

- What is it?
- Who is the target audience?
- What is your "Unique Selling Proposition" or what makes you difference from the competition?
- Close with a strong "Call to Action"!

Hi, I'm Elena.  I'm a seasoned business intelligence specialist with a knack for turning data into actionable insights. I excel at finding, extracting, wrangling, analyzing, and visualizing complex datasets to drive model development and informed decision-making--these might be applied to building KPIs and OKRs, for example, or for prioritizing a technology product backlog. I'm interested that your organization is <doing something>, and I would love more information about that.

Your elevator pitch for mock interviews should be (approximately):

Hi, I'm Elena, I'm a seasoned business intelligence specialist, with deep experience in sql and Tableau.
I am currently enrolled with Savvy to enhance my skills around python, the git/github ecosystem, 
and the end to end data analysis/data science pipeline.
I chose a capstone about airline pricing because it's fun to think about traveling, and 
the data set calls for some interesting web scraping, PDF parsing, data wrangling, and visualization.
I was originally hoping to find out whether prices are lower on Tuesdays, but I can't find data at that
level of granularity.

### Introductory Speech

The introduction speech is meant for Demo Day. It builds on the Elevator Pitch. The individuals that come to Demo Day want to hear a bit of a “story” about you, how you got to Demo Day, and about your capstone project!
