## Goals for data analytics course
* Learn to set up an IDE, and become comfortable with git and github (I came in with a coding background, so learning python is not a key goal for me, but I don't have up to date experience on the devops side)
* Do a capstone project, to:
  * Go through the end to end process of creating a data analysis visualization
  * Learn more python tools, in service of the capstone (eg [beautifulsoup](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/))
  * Go through the process of creating a capstone video
  * Have the capstone project as part of the portfolio I can present to potential employers.
* Incorporate hands-on data analysis in the next job I get
  * Understand what job title and elevator pitch appropriately capture what I want to do.
  * Update and improve my job hunting collateral
  * Receive knowledgeable guidance about what organizations and positions to target
  * Benefit as appropriate from SavvyCoders's extensive network of connections with employers in the Midwest

I love that this image summarizes the whole data science life cycle.  I am working to pick up some data science tools on my own, in addition to what we are learning for the class, so I like seeing the whole picture, not just the data analysis part.
