## **Speeches**

Everyday there are opportunities to market yourself and pitch your brand. You want to be ready to shine when those moments come!

The moment dictates what type of speech ew can deliver. Sometimes it's a quick Elevator pitch, an introductory speech, or a full presentation. By preparing in advance for every occasion, you'll always be ready to deliver!

### Elevator Pitch

- What is it?
- Who is the target audience?
- What is your "Unique Selling Proposition" or what makes you difference from the competition?
- Close with a strong "Call to Action"!

Hi, I'm Elena.  I’m a seasoned tech product manager who utilizes data-driven decision making to optimize performance of enterprise teams delivering anything from health care services to financial trading applications. I can bring alignment to stakeholders from C suite to quirky brilliant individual contributors, and I can move from broad strategic vision to highly tactical execution at a moment's notice.  I’m looking for an organization which values honest, prompt, pragmatic, data-driven decision making.  I'm interested that your organization is "doing something--fill in as appropriate", and I would love to be part of that because xyz."  Can you tell me how this role fits into that mission?

Your elevator pitch for mock interviews should be (approximately):

Hi, I'm Elena, I'm a seasoned tech product manager, with deep experience in sql and Tableau, and
I am currently enrolled with Savvy to enhance my skills around python, the git/github ecosystem, 
and the end to end data analysis/data science pipeline.
I chose a capstone about investment strategies in the electric vehicle space because we are doing a related class project
about electric vehicle charging stations, and because my last job was at a proprietary trading firm.  This is a great opportunity
to use data to explain some of what goes into investment decisions.

### Introductory Speech

The introduction speech is meant for Demo Day. It builds on the Elevator Pitch. The individuals that come to Demo Day want to hear a bit of a “story” about you, how you got to Demo Day, and about your capstone project!

- Explain "Why" you created this SPA
- What business problem is the SPA solving
- High Level Summary of the SPA functionality
- How is this SPA going to solve the stated problem

to use data to explain some of what goes into investment decisions, to give anyone who is curious about dipping their
toes in this water a little more information before they try it.

At a high level, I look at performance of about eight competitors to Tesla over the past year and evaluate the performance using different lenses which I can also explain using the data--return on investiment, risk-adjusted return on investment using the "Sharpe ratio," and so on.  (Still researching the lenses)
