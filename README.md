## Goals for data analytics course
* Learn to set up an IDE, and become comfortable with git and github (I came in with a coding background, so learning python is not a key goal for me, but I don't have up to date experience on the devops side)
* Do a capstone project, to:
  * Go through the end to end process of creating a data analysis visualization
  * Learn more python tools, in service of the capstone (eg [beautifulsoup](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/))
  * Go through the process of creating a capstone video
  * Have the capstone project as part of the portfolio I can present to potential employers.
* Incorporate hands-on data analysis in the next job I get
  * Understand what job title and elevator pitch appropriately capture what I want to do.
  * Update and improve my job hunting collateral
  * Take advantage of SavvyCoders's presence in the job market to find a new job
